Note Well:
Node-Red will not open unless the local server client has node and
the Node-Red extension installed.
Once installed
http://localhost:1880/#flow/55e22fddf4f7f530
Once Deployed
http://localhost:1880/ui/#!/0?socketid=blEUR6d-svoCA891AAAD

Neither Link will launch until host client has launched Node-Red.
